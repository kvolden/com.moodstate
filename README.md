Moods in Homey are inherently state-less. They are descriptions of light devices and settings that can be activated, but do not contain any lasting state that describe whether the associated light values still remain.

This app provides a way to simulate stateful moods through flow cards that allow moods to be compared with current light settings. If the lights set by the mood have the same values as the mood would set them to, it is considered active.
